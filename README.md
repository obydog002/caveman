# Caveman
Caveman is a game that I played while travelling on Singapore and Quantas airlines. As the game was only available on airplane rides, as a fun project I decided to recreate it.

# Gameplay
Play as a caveman and get to the end of the level. Push blocks to create paths, or make your own with clubs. Watch out for the pesky mammoths, espically the red ones!
