# Caveman
Caveman is a game found on Singapore and Quantas airlines entertainment systems. To the best of my knowledge the game is only available on airplane rides, and so I decided to recreate it.

## Gameplay
Play as a caveman and get to the end of the level. Push blocks to create paths, or make your own with clubs. Watch out for the pesky mammoths, especially the red ones!

Do what you want with the code, including contribution or commercial stuff.
