# Caveman
Caveman is a game found on Singapore and Quantas airlines entertainment systems. To the best of my knowledge the game is only available on airplane rides, and so I decided to recreate it.

## Gameplay
Play as a caveman and get to the end of the level. Push blocks to create paths, or make your own with clubs. Watch out for the pesky mammoths, especially the red ones!

## How to play
clone this repository, then run the "make" file (which is just a windows batch file with four javac commands for each of the packages), or compile each of the four packages with javac src/\<package\>/\*.java from the caveman folder.

Run the game with java src.game.Main .
